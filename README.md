# Services Module

## About

The [Foundation](https://github.com/robmllze/foundation) template is divided into several modules. This helps separate concerns and makes it easier to manage the codebase.

This is the Services Module from the Foundation, which outlines services and functionalities for data handling. It's designed to comply with the patterns specified in the `_service_interfaces` module, to promote a structured framework.

It comprises of the following:

- **Data Services**: Services related to specific data models.
- **Data Utils**: Utilities related to specific data models or services.
- **Service Brokers**: Brokers that enable interaction with specified back-end services in a generic manner.
- **Service Environments**: Classes that act as containers for sets of essential cloud services such as the `FirebaseServiceEnvironemnt`.
- **System Services**: Services that utilize system resources, such as location.

## Notes

- Rename `_services-foundation` to `_services` before using it in your project.
- Services are modular, reusable, and interchangeable classes that interact with various resources (e.g., data models, system resources, cloud services) in a generic manner.
